(Kazoku Collective Logo)

Kazoku Collective is a growing network of online communities celebrating things we love. Our focus is on providing spaces for people to geek out about particular niche media that might not otherwise have a dedicated space on the internet. 「家族」 or 'Kazoku' is a Japanese word which means 'family', and that perfectly describes the kind of communites we hope to foster. It's about bringing the love back to communities; making it feel less depersonalised and more homely. The communities of the Kazoku Collective share a mutual passion for discussing and analysing media at great depth. They're fun and welcoming places for everybody to join in celebrating the things they love together. Just take a look at our communities below. Whether you're new to the media or a longtime fan, we hope you'll consider joining one of our families!

**Content below. Maybe split the page down the middle into two columns, one talking about Kazamatsuri and one talking about Rokkenjima?

Kazamatsuri is a home for English-speaking fans of Key's visual novels and related media. It is a community of highly introspective and empathic people who look to Key's evocative stories for emotional catharsis and to discover what deeper messages about life and existence can be found behind the words. If titles like "CLANNAD", "Angel Beats!", "Little Busters!" and "Rewrite" ring any bells, then you'll have some idea of what Key is all about. When they're not busy discussing these moving stories, they're busy having fun playing games and joking around, reflecting the two faces of Key's narrative structure well. If Key is of any interest to you, we hope you'll consider joining our family.

(Rokkenjima Logo)

Rokkenjima is a new community for English-speaking fans of 07th Expansion and Ryukishi07's works. Ryukishi07's writing is characterised by it's disturbing yet beautiful depictions of humanity. For many, the central appeal of 07th Expansion is from the 'When They Cry' series of detective fiction, where reality and illusions overlap to obscure the truth. Rokkenjima is a home for lovers of mystery, philosophy and the human heart. Whether it be crafting and debating theories to explain Ryukishi07's worlds, searching for the deeper messages behind the stories, or creating our own mysteries to challenge others with, there's something to suit everyone's tastes, whether they're human or witch. Won't you join our tea party?
